# FlightSimController
Make a Joystick for MS Flight Simulator or any.

Firstly special thanks to MHeironimus for Library. https://github.com/MHeironimus/ArduinoJoystickLibrary

If you want to joystick on Windows especially like Flight Simulator app or any. You can download and use them.

You can use Leonardo or Micro. I have written on the Leonardo firstly. Then I have written them on the Micro. Now I see I can make it with RP2040 but I didnt try it. May be you will try it.
